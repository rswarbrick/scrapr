This is a common lisp script/application to pull the "original size"
image urls from an image set on Flickr.

I wrote it because I needed to grab >100 photos from someone elses
Flickr account that they had taken at a concert I was involved with
and "helpfully" shared by uploading to Flickr. Sigh.

Anyway, the only software I could find that did this was Windows-based
and nasty, so I rolled a brittle web-scraping version for myself.

To use it:

  (1) Somehow make the scrapr.asd appear in your asdf repository
      list. It seems there's crazy stuff you have to do on Windows. On
      linux, symlink it to your asdf "systems" folder.

  (2) Install drakma and cl-ppcre (both available via asdf-install).

  (3) Use it! For example:

        (require :scrapr)
        (original-photo-urls "username" "setregexp" "urls.txt")


Oh, and let me know if it works!


BUGS:

 * This fails ungracefully if a photo doesn't have an original size
   available. Note that this happens if the user who owns the set
   isn't a "pro" member. This is easily fixable, I think, but it's not
   been a problem for me yet!

LICENSING:
(This is last on purpose)

I hereby grant anyone the license to do anything they like with this
code. It's released into the public domain in countries where that
means anything, and otherwise is available under the BSD licence.
